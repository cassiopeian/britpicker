 Feeling tripped up by esprit de l’escalier? The Insult Generator can create a seemingly endless number of slights, with the click of a button.

 + **Insult Me Button** &mdash; Pairs randomized adjectives and nouns, to create a new insult. The button’s confrontational text will also change, with each click.
 + **Like Button** &mdash; Builds a list of your favorite put-downs.
 + **Return Button** &mdash; Recalls the previous insult, in case you regret not adding it to your list.
 + **Lock Buttons** &mdash; Maintain adjectives or nouns that speak to you. In the example, above, *prat* was locked, so it’s repeated in the sixth insult.
 + **Delete Buttons** &mdash; Remove insults you change your mind about. These buttons trigger a confirmation pop-up.
